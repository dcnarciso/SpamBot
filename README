Welcome to Spambot!

SpamBot_v2 is the latest version of SpamBot. He might not run for you because I don't know how discord hosts bot info. But the code is there.

df_cards_war is a pickled pandas dataframe containing basic card information for the War of the Spark set.

mtg_CardBot.py will scrape an mtg wiki for card info for a given set. It's only set up to be WAR.
You'll need the 3-letter abbreviation for each set you want to add to the dataframe, as well as how many cards are in the set. That bot should be able to get the rest.
